# Climatecoin

Script for a subcurrency on Ethereum, denominated in tonnes CO2. Instead of mining, donate Ether to offset carbon. Currency is minted in proportion to global carbon emissions, and the share you get is equal to the share of carbon offsets you contribute.

See the [ClimateColab entry](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/1301417/planId/1313601).
