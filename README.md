# Climatecoin

Script for a subcurrency on Ethereum, denominated in tonnes CO2. Instead of mining, donate Ether to offset carbon. 

Total coins minted is equal to total tonnes carbon emitted globally since coin launch. If emissions and offset were balanced, then one tonne offset would reward one coin. Until then the reward is multiplied by (total emissions / total offsets).

See the [ClimateColab entry](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/1301417/planId/1313601).
